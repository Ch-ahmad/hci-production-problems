## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=1040u0kZXptRzYpNXWAZO9K+Xd0
Your Rationale: This color is Scarlet Red, this is the color set of all the latest gaming laptops, consoles, and game pages. Every intense game includes this color. I have chosen it not just because of what's already in the market, but rather because of the color's aggressiveness, and its feel on the user.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=51J050kueCpsFLeqOJewyt8IsB7
Your Rationale: This color is sun-flower yellow, when talking about spring time or garden, the only colors attached to your feelings would be yellow or green. It isn't surprising that yellow symbolizes happiness, warmth and sunshine in most cultures; these are characteristics of the yellow sun and its effects.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=14d0z0km5FixRc5NFvg1WV72f+L
Your Rationale: This color is "medium slate blue", according to research on kids favorite colors were: Fuchsia, Green & Blue. These 3 colors were reported to spark creativity and willingness to do work. Blue is the color of space and freedom in most parts of the world, so it won't have any opposite effects.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=54H0g0k266y02sX1ItUpH3yNK9+
Your Rationale: This color is "Dark slate gray" The colors which are originally used to represent cyber security are black-gray or blue-white . I have chosen this because of the overall effect of dark gray, it is a color that represent style and balance. In history it is associated with wisdome that comes with age. Other than this vs-code also has a semi dark gray background which many of the programmers are comfortable with.
